I honestly had no idea how to even begin doing this assignment. I looked up a tutorial that classmates recommended which I did not find helpful. I did not want to copy and paste things from a tutorial because I wouldn't gain any understanding of the material.  

After struggling with the assignment for days without making much progress, I ended up hiring a JavaScript tutor. He did not write the code for me- we looked over the directions and he explained concepts and shard resources with me about how promises, fetching, and APIs work. I coded the JavaScript portion live with him while he gave me pointers and gained useful information on JavaScript in general. I will likely take general JavaScript lessons with him in the future to get a better grasp on more basic concepts that I struggle with. Constanly Googling everything does not work for me.

The resources I viewed came from Mozilla and W3 Schools.
